# Security Policy

## Project Purpose

This is a **demonstration project** created for educational and portfolio purposes. It simulates a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response) incident management API.

## Security Considerations

### Demo Limitations

This project intentionally includes simplified security implementations for demonstration purposes:

- **Hardcoded Tokens**: Uses demo token `demo-token-123` for testing
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data is not persisted or encrypted
- **HTTP Protocol**: Runs on localhost without HTTPS
- **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse
- **Simplified Auth**: Basic bearer token instead of enterprise-grade authentication

### Production Security Requirements

If adapting this code for production use, implement these security measures:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Replace hardcoded tokens with environment variables
- Implement proper JWT tokens with expiration and refresh
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use OAuth 2.0 or enterprise SSO integration
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)

#### Data Protection
- Use encrypted database storage (PostgreSQL with TDE)
- Implement data classification and retention policies
- Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Use secrets management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

#### Network Security
- Deploy with HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Network segmentation and firewall rules
- VPN or private network access

#### Monitoring & Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Compliance with industry standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Incident response procedures

## Reporting Security Issues

Since this is a demonstration project, security issues should be reported as regular GitHub issues. Please include:

1. Description of the potential security concern
2. Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
3. Suggested improvements or fixes
4. Impact assessment
