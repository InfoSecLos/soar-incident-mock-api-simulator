# Security Policy

## Project Purpose

This is a **demonstration project** created for educational and portfolio purposes. It simulates a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response) incident management API.


### Demo Limitations

This project intentionally includes simplified security implementations for demonstration purposes:

- **Hardcoded Tokens**: Uses demo token `demo-token-123` for testing
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data is not persisted or encrypted
- **HTTP Protocol**: Runs on localhost without HTTPS
- **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse
- **Simplified Auth**: Basic bearer token instead of enterprise-grade authentication
